- title: "Binding specificities of human RNA-binding proteins toward structured and linear RNA sequences"
  image: GR_2021.png
  description: We assembled a genome-scale collection of RBPs and their RNA-binding domains (RBDs) and assessed their specificities using high-throughput RNA-SELEX (HTR-SELEX). Approximately 30% preferred structured motifs folding into stem–loops. We also found that many RBPs can bind to multiple distinctly different motifs. Structural analysis revealed that unconventional RBDs containing active sites or molecule-binding pockets could interact with short, structured RNA molecules.

- title: "CRISPR/Cas9 screening using unique molecular identifiers"
  image: msb177834_2017.jpeg
  description: Loss-of-function screening by CRISPR/Cas9 gene knockout with pooled, lentiviral guide libraries is a widely applicable method for systematic identification of genes contributing to diverse cellular phenotypes. Here, Random Sequence Labels (RSLs) are incorporated into the guide library, which act as unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) to allow massively parallel lineage tracing and lineage dropout screening. RSLs greatly improve the reproducibility of results by increasing both the precision and the accuracy of screens. They reduce the number of cells needed to reach a set statistical power, or allow a more robust screen using the same number of cells.
